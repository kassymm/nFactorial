# Ну, погоди!

## An egg catching game

The game was written using the Pygame library.

The game has 3 levels of egg rolling speed. Also, in each level of difficulty, the rate of egg spawning increases with time.
You have 3 lives, indicated by the chick shadows on the upper left corner of the gaming window. Once the egg drops to the ground, you lose a life and a chick turns black. 

Once the game is over, you will be asked to provide your nickname. Click the button to type and insert your nick. If successful, you will see your name on the leaderboard!

### Instructions
Install the pygame library.

Run the game.py file to start the game.

You will be welcomed by the start menu with the leaderboard of top prior players.

Press SPACE to start the game.

Once in the game interface, use the (d, f, j, k) key buttons to swith the basket between the (upper left, bottom left, upper right, bottom right) nests respectively.

### Developer tools

If desired, you can adjust the fps_cap in the game.py file to change the refresh rate.
To add more spice, you can also adjust the add_egg_increment variable in the main() function to change the rate of egg spawning.


Enjoy!
